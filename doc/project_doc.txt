-	Divorce rate
-	Community mobility (Google)
-	Music preferences
-	Students’ grades


Introduction


Questions

-	What are the mobility trends in Canada?
o	How do mobility trends change as time progresses?
o	How do mobility trends differ across provinces and territories in Canada?
o	Which provinces were the most/least active in social distancing?

-	What factors drove these trends?
o	Number of cases in Canada
o	Number of cases around the world
o	Temperature
o	Precipitation
o	Weather
o	Number of days into social-distancing
o	Population density
o	Urbanness
o	Economy

-	Can we cross reference the mobility trends with Google Trends?

-	Apple Mobility Trends Report?

-	Do these trends reflect the number of cases increases in Canada?
o	Social-distancing score


Data Collection

-	Google Community Mobility Reports
-	WHO COVID-19 map data

To-do

-	What should we explore? What plots should we make?
o	What places did people visit the most? Bar plot
o	Cross reference most/least popular places with Google Trends. Line plot
o	How do the mobility trends vary from day to day across different categories in Canada/provinces and territories? Line plot

-	Devise an evaluation metric to measure how well did people do in social distancing – Social Distancing score
o	Visualize social distancing in map. Grace? Geospatial data? Google map API?
o	How does social distancing score vary from day to day across categories in Canada/provinces and territories? Line plot

-	Build a statistical model to investigate what factors contribute to the social distancing score
o	Multiple Linear Regression
	P-value
o	Random Forest Regression
	Permutation Feature Importance


Problems encountered

-	How to analyze weather (i.e. temperature, precipitation, etc.) of a country?
-	We couldn’t collect weather data for a country. Should we narrow down our model from predicting the social-distancing score of a country to the social-distancing score of a province (e.g. Ontario)?
-	WHO COVID-19 data and Government of Canada Ontario Toronto City station weather data does not have an active link for download.
